We have a shared basic and functional prototype. The prototype is just a simple HTML page. 
What I already have is a Git repository (both locally and on GitHub), connection and publication of the page via Netlify, and the overall plan.
I want to expand the prototype into an application that will emulate a small client zone. I want the application to be written in JavaScript, use my existing infrastructure with Netlify, and have the following parameters.

The URL of the prototype is: https://lnd-poj.netlify.app/

My feature requirements are:

- Basic login and hiding from the public
- Multi-step form with basic validations
- Use of camera for file upload
- Option to view contract in lightweight KZ
- Styling and colors of Lunde-poj prototype
